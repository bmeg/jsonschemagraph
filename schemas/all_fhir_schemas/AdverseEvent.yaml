$id: AdverseEvent
additionalProperties: false
description: An event that may be related to unintended effects on a patient or research
  participant. An event (i.e. any change to current patient status) that may be related
  to unintended effects on a patient or research participant. The unintended effects
  may require additional monitoring, treatment, hospitalization, or may result in
  death. The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided events that
  could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the AdverseEvent
  resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported adverse events
  and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical  research trial management.
  Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers, patients, caregivers or
  by medical products manufacturers. Given the differences between these two concepts,
  we recommend consulting the domain specific implementation guides when implementing
  the AdverseEvent Resource. The implementation guides include specific extensions,
  value sets and constraints. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/AdverseEvent.html]

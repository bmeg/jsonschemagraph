$id: ClinicalImpression
additionalProperties: false
description: A clinical assessment performed when planning treatments and management
  strategies for a patient. A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine
  what problem(s) may affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management
  strategies that are best to manage a patient's condition. Assessments are often
  1:1 with a clinical consultation / encounter,  but this varies greatly depending
  on the clinical workflow. This resource is called "ClinicalImpression" rather than
  "ClinicalAssessment" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools such
  as Apgar score. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ClinicalImpression.html]

    description: May be used to represent additional information that is not part
      of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of
      the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing
      element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
      of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required
      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

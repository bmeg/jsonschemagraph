      of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of
      the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing
      element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
      of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required
      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

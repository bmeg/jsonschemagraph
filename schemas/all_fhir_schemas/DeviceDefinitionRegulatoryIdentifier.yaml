$id: DeviceDefinitionRegulatoryIdentifier
additionalProperties: false
description: Regulatory identifier(s) associated with this device. Identifier associated
  with the regulatory documentation (certificates, technical documentation, post-market
  surveillance documentation and reports) of a set of device models sharing the same
  intended purpose, risk class and essential design and manufacturing characteristics.
  One example is the Basic UDI-DI in Europe. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/DeviceDefinitionRegulatoryIdentifier.html]

      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
      of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required
      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

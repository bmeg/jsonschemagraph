description: Resource in the implementation guide. A resource that is part of the
  implementation guide. Conformance resources (value set, structure definition, capability
  statements etc.) are obvious candidates for inclusion, but any kind of resource
  can be included as an example resource. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ImplementationGuideDefinitionResource.html]

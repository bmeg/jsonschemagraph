  url:
    description: An absolute URI that is used to identify this measure when it is
      referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
      canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
      address at which an authoritative instance of this measure is (or will be) published.
      This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same
      when the measure is stored on different servers.

      contexts that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender,
      age, ...) or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies,
      ...) and may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate measure
      instances.

  version:
    description: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the measure
      when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
      an arbitrary value managed by the measure author and is not expected to be globally
      unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version
      is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in
      a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision
      Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0).
      For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support
      Service specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental
      active artifacts.

description: Resource in the implementation guide. A resource that is part of the
  implementation guide. Conformance resources (value set, structure definition, capability
  statements etc.) are obvious candidates for inclusion, but any kind of resource
  can be included as an example resource. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ImplementationGuideManifestResource.html]

      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
      of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required
      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

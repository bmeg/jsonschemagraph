description: This subclause refers to the description of each subunit constituting
  the SubstanceProtein. A subunit is a linear sequence of amino acids linked through
  peptide bonds. The Subunit information shall be provided when the finished SubstanceProtein
  is a complex of multiple sequences; subunits are not used to delineate domains within
  a single sequence. Subunits are listed in order of decreasing length; sequences
  of the same length will be ordered by decreasing molecular weight; subunits that
  have identical sequences will be repeated multiple times. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/SubstanceProteinSubunit.html]

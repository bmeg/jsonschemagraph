$id: MessageHeader
additionalProperties: false
description: A resource that describes a message that is exchanged between systems.
  The header for a message exchange that is either requesting or responding to an
  action.  The reference(s) that are the subject of the action as well as other information
  related to the action are typically transmitted in a bundle in which the MessageHeader
  resource instance is the first resource in the bundle. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/MessageHeader.html]

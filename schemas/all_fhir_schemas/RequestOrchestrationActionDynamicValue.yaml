description: Dynamic aspects of the definition. Customizations that should be applied
  to the statically defined resource. For example, if the dosage of a medication must
  be computed based on the patient's weight, a customization would be used to specify
  an expression that calculated the weight, and the path on the resource that would
  contain the result. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/RequestOrchestrationActionDynamicValue.html]

      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
      of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required
      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

      (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality
      sub-elements (see the [Simple FHIRPath Profile](fhirpath.html#simple) for full

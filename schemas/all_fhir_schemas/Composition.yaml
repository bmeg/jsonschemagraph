$id: Composition
additionalProperties: false
description: A set of resources composed into a single coherent clinical statement
  with clinical attestation. A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled
  together into a single logical package that provides a single coherent statement
  of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard
  to who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative
  content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not constitute
  a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a Bundle where Bundle.type=document,
  and any other resources referenced from Composition must be included as subsequent
  entries in the Bundle (for example Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.). [See
  https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/Composition.html]

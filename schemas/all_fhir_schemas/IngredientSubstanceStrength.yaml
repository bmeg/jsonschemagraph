additionalProperties: false
description: The quantity of substance, per presentation, or per volume or mass, and
  type of quantity. The quantity of substance in the unit of presentation, or in the
  volume (or mass) of the single pharmaceutical product or manufactured item. The
  allowed repetitions do not represent different strengths, but are different representations
  - mathematically equivalent - of a single strength. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/IngredientSubstanceStrength.html]

      position relative to the point of aerosolization.

      element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.

      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the

  referenceStrength:
    description: Strength expressed in terms of a reference substance. For when the
      ingredient strength is additionally expressed as equivalent to the strength
      of some other closely related substance (e.g. salt vs. base). Reference strength
      represents the strength (quantitative composition) of the active moiety of the
      active substance. There are situations when the active substance and active
      moiety are different, therefore both a strength and a reference strength are
      needed.

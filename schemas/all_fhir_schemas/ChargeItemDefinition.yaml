$id: ChargeItemDefinition
additionalProperties: false
description: Definition of properties and rules about how the price and the applicability
  of a ChargeItem can be determined. The ChargeItemDefinition resource provides the
  properties that apply to the (billing) codes necessary to calculate costs and prices.
  The properties may differ largely depending on type and realm, therefore this resource
  gives only a rough structure and requires profiling for each type of billing code
  system. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ChargeItemDefinition.html]

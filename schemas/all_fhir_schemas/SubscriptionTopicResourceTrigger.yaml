$id: SubscriptionTopicResourceTrigger
additionalProperties: false
description: Definition of a resource-based trigger for the subscription topic. A
  definition of a resource-based event that triggers a notification based on the SubscriptionTopic.
  The criteria may be just a human readable description and/or a full FHIR search
  string or FHIRPath expression. Multiple triggers are considered OR joined (e.g.,
  a resource update matching ANY of the definitions will trigger a notification).

      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

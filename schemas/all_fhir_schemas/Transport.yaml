      make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed
      to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as
      part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource
      are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT
      change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including
      cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

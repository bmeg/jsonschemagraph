      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part

      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

description: A code system supported by the server. Identifies a code system that
  is supported by the server. If there is a no code system URL, then this declares
  the general assumptions a client can make about support for any CodeSystem resource.

      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can

      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

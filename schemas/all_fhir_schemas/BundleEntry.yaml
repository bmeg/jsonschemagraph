      MAY be set to a urn:uuid to allow referencing entries in a transaction. The
      fullUrl can be an arbitrary URI and is not limited to urn:uuid, urn:oid, http,

      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

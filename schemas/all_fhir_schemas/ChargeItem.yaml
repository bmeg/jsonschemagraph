$id: ChargeItem
additionalProperties: false
description: Item containing charge code(s) associated with the provision of healthcare
  provider products. The resource ChargeItem describes the provision of healthcare
  provider products for a certain patient, therefore referring not only to the product,
  but containing in addition details of the provision, like date, time, amounts and

  containedItemQuantity:
    description: A total of the complete count of contained items of a particular

      as the pack size. This attribute differs from containedItem.amount in that it
      can give a single aggregated count of all tablet types in a pack, even when
      these are different manufactured items. For example a pill pack of 21 tablets
      plus 7 sugar tablets, can be denoted here as '28 tablets'. This attribute is
      repeatable so that the different item types in one pack type can be counted
      (e.g. a count of vials and count of syringes). Each repeat must have different
      units, so that it is clear what the different sets of counted items are, and
      it is not intended to allow different counts of similar items (e.g. not '2 tubes
      and 3 tubes'). Repeats are not to be used to represent different pack sizes
      (e.g. 20 pack vs. 50 pack) - which would be different instances of this resource.

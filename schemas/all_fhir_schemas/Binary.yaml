  represents the data of a single raw artifact as digital content accessible in its
  native format.  A Binary resource can contain any content, whether text, image,

      rules for the Binary resource. Given that the Binary resource contains very
      few elements that can be used to determine the sensitivity of the data and relationships
      to individuals, the referenced resource stands in as a proxy equivalent for
      this purpose. This referenced resource may be related to the Binary (e.g. DocumentReference),
      or may be some non-related Resource purely as a security proxy. E.g. to identify
      that the binary resource relates to a patient, and access should only be granted
      to applications that have access to the patient.

$id: SubstanceSourceMaterial
additionalProperties: false
description: 'Source material shall capture information on the taxonomic and anatomical
  origins as well as the fraction of a material that can result in or can be modified
  to form a substance. This set of data elements shall be used to define polymer substances
  isolated from biological matrices. Taxonomic and anatomical origins shall be described
  using a controlled vocabulary as required. This information is captured for naturally
  derived polymers ( . starch) and structurally diverse substances. For Organisms
  belonging to the Kingdom Plantae the Substance level defines the fresh material
  of a single species or infraspecies, the Herbal Drug and the Herbal preparation.
  For Herbal preparations, the fraction information will be captured at the Substance
  information level and additional information for herbal extracts will be captured
  at the Specified Substance Group 1 information level. See for further explanation
  the Substance Class: Structurally Diverse and the herbal annex. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/SubstanceSourceMaterial.html]'

  instructions as structured data.  This repeating structure allows for changing the
  administration rate or volume over time for both bolus and continuous feeding.  An
  example of this would be an instruction to increase the rate of continuous feeding
  every 2 hours. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/NutritionOrderEnteralFormulaAdministration.html]

$id: SubstanceSourceMaterialFractionDescription
additionalProperties: false
description: Many complex materials are fractions of parts of plants, animals, or
  minerals. Fraction elements are often necessary to define both Substances and Specified
  Group 1 Substances. For substances derived from Plants, fraction information will
  be captured at the Substance information level ( . Oils, Juices and Exudates). Additional
  information for Extracts, such as extraction solvent composition, will be captured
  at the Specified Substance Group 1 information level. For plasma-derived products
  fraction information will be captured at the Substance and the Specified Substance
  Group 1 levels. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/SubstanceSourceMaterialFractionDescription.html]

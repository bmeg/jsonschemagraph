$id: PlanDefinition
additionalProperties: false
description: The definition of a plan for a series of actions, independent of any
  specific patient or context. This resource allows for the definition of various
  types of plans as a sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. The resource
  is general enough to support the description of a broad range of clinical and non-
  clinical artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, order sets, protocols,
  and drug quality specifications. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/PlanDefinition.html]

  version:
    description: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the plan
      definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance.
      This is an arbitrary value managed by the plan definition author and is not
      expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd)
      if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
      can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent
      with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision
      (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to
      the Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required
      for non-experimental active artifacts.

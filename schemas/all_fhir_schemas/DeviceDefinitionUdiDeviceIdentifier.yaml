  (UDI) assigned to device label or package.  Note that the Device may include multiple
  udiCarriers as it either may include just the udiCarrier for the jurisdiction it
  is sold, or for multiple jurisdictions it could have been sold. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/DeviceDefinitionUdiDeviceIdentifier.html]

      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part

      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

$id: IngredientSubstanceStrengthReferenceStrength
additionalProperties: false
description: Strength expressed in terms of a reference substance. Strength expressed
  in terms of a reference substance. For when the ingredient strength is additionally
  expressed as equivalent to the strength of some other closely related substance
  (e.g. salt vs. base). Reference strength represents the strength (quantitative composition)
  of the active moiety of the active substance. There are situations when the active
  substance and active moiety are different, therefore both a strength and a reference
  strength are needed. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/IngredientSubstanceStrengthReferenceStrength.html]

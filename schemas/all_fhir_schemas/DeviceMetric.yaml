      BP in green, and PR and SpO2 in magenta.

      often, the measurementFrequency may be based on a unit other than time, such
      as distance (e.g. for a measuring wheel). The update period may be different
      than the measurement frequency, if the device does not update the published
      observed value with the same frequency as it was measured.

$id: ImagingSelectionInstanceImageRegion2D
additionalProperties: false
description: A specific 2D region in a DICOM image / frame. Each imaging selection
  instance or frame list might includes an image region, specified by a region type
  and a set of 2D coordinates.        If the parent imagingSelection.instance contains
  a subset element of type frame, the image region applies to all frames in the subset
  list. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ImagingSelectionInstanceImageRegion2D.html] [See

  coordinate:
    description: The coordinates describing the image region. Encoded as a set of
      (column, row) pairs that denote positions in the selected image / frames specified
      with sub-pixel resolution.        The origin at the TLHC of the TLHC pixel is
      0.0\0.0, the BRHC of the TLHC pixel is 1.0\1.0, and the BRHC of the BRHC pixel
      is the number of columns\rows in the image / frames. The values must be within
      the range 0\0 to the number of columns\rows in the image / frames.

      element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
      of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required
      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

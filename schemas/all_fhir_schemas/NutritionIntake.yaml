$id: NutritionIntake
additionalProperties: false
description: Record of food or fluid being taken by a patient. A record of food or
  fluid that is being consumed by a patient.   A NutritionIntake may indicate that
  the patient may be consuming the food or fluid now or has consumed the food or fluid
  in the past.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other
  (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this
  information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit
  or stay or through an app that tracks food or fluids consumed.   The consumption
  information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a nutrition
  label,  or from a clinician documenting observed intake. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/NutritionIntake.html]

$id: MedicationDispenseSubstitution
additionalProperties: false
description: Whether a substitution was performed on the dispense. Indicates whether
  or not substitution was made as part of the dispense.  In some cases, substitution
  will be expected but does not happen, in other cases substitution is not expected

  why.  If nothing is specified, substitution was not done. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/MedicationDispenseSubstitution.html]

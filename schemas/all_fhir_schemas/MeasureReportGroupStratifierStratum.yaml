$id: MeasureReportGroupStratifierStratum
additionalProperties: false
description: Stratum results, one for each unique value, or set of values, in the
  stratifier, or stratifier components. This element contains the results for a single
  stratum within the stratifier. For example, when stratifying on administrative gender,
  there will be four strata, one for each possible gender value. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/MeasureReportGroupStratifierStratum.html]

      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the

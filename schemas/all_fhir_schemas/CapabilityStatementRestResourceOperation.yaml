  definition:
    description: Where the formal definition can be found. If a server references
      the base definition of an Operation (i.e. from the specification itself such
      as ```http://hl7.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/ValueSet-expand```), that means
      it supports the full capabilities of the operation - e.g. both GET and POST
      invocation.  If it only supports a subset, it must define its own custom [OperationDefinition](operationdefinition.html#)
      with a 'base' of the original OperationDefinition.  The custom definition would
      describe the specific subset of functionality supported.

      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
      of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required
      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

      _query parameter when the query is called. This SHOULD be the same as the OperationDefinition.code
      of the defining OperationDefinition.  However, it can sometimes differ if necessary
      to disambiguate when a server supports multiple OperationDefinition that happen
      to share the same code.

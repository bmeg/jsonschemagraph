    description: The population basis specifies the type of elements in the population.
      For a subject-based measure, this is boolean (because the subject and the population
      basis are the same, and the population criteria define yes/no values for each
      individual in the population). For measures that have a population basis that
      is different than the subject, this element specifies the type of the population
      basis. For example, an encounter-based measure has a subject of Patient and
      a population basis of Encounter, and the population criteria all return lists
      of Encounters.
